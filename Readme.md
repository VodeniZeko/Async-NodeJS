# Async Node

## Description

This repository contains a simple demonstration of the asynchronous nature of Node.js. The code showcases how Node.js handles asynchronous operations, such as file reading, HTTP requests, and database queries, without blocking the execution of other tasks.

## Features

- Asynchronous file reading using Node.js `fs` module.
- Making asynchronous HTTP requests with Node.js `http` or `axios` library.
- Performing asynchronous database queries using Node.js `mongodb` or `mysql` module.

## Installation

To run the demonstration locally, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:VodeniZeko/Async-NodeJS.git`
* Navigate to the project directory: `cd async-nodejs`
* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Run the demonstration: `npm start`

## Usage

### The code in this repository demonstrates various asynchronous operations in Node.js. 
Explore the different files in the src directory to see examples of asynchronous file reading, HTTP requests, and database queries. 
Each file contains comments explaining the code and its output.
